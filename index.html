  <h4>Geo-visualisation of Earthquake data from USGS Earthquake Catalogue</h4>
 <p>I have chosen to visualize the earthquakes happening over a period of 48 hours (to grasp the sheer number of earthquakes happening over such a small time frame). The start and end time of the data set were from 2004-12-25 (00:00:00) to 2004-12-26 (23:59:59). This specific time was chosen to get a data set which had earthquakes of all magnitudes (9.1 magnitude earthquake took place in Sumatra on 26th December, 2004).</p>
